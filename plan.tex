Our workflow for the compiler consisted of an initial version with output statements completed by the architect.
The intention was that group members would then add their language features to the compiler through the entire pipline.
Parsing properly, semantically checking, and then generating code that compiled and ran.
There was test infrastructure in place throughout the entire project to gaurantee that none of the added features were broken by subsequent commits.

We worked in an agile workflow of completing a feature through one step of the compiler before asking for feedback from the remainder of the group through the ``Pull Request'' feature of Github.
This worked very well to prevent members from getting too far off track during their implementation.
