Failure to stick to a strict weekly team meeting made it difficult to get consistent work done by the group at large.
We made a plan that 1 \- 2 members would write out the first section of the compiler pipeline.
This worked well, but it should have been completed at an earlier date to give others more time to ramp up with the project.
The late ramp up in work on the project created issues with code generation because we chose a target language that only one group member had experience with.
In retrospect, we could (and should) have transitioned to a more common language, Java, that we all had familiarity with.
